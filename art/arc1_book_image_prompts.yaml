#A YAML file describing image prompts for each K–2 book.  Use the same “meta‑ultra‑hyperrealistic Renaissance oil painting” style as the GCB art prompts.  For example, Book 1 (God Made Everything) could depict Genesis creation scenes with golden‑brown tones and no modern objects; Book 2 (Phonics of the Promise) might show children learning Hebrew letters with light filtering through scrolls; etc.
